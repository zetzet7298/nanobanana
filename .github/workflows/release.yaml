# It will trigger automatically whenever you push a new tag that starts with 'v' (e.g., v1.0.0).

    steps:
      # 1. Checks out your repository's code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20" # Specify the Node.js version you use
          cache: "npm"

      # 3. Installs root dependencies
      # We use 'npm ci' which is faster and safer for CI/CD environments
      - name: Install root dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Install MCP server dependencies
      # The MCP server needs its dependencies bundled in the release
      - name: Install MCP server dependencies
        run: cd mcp-server && npm ci

      # 5. Runs your build script
      # This assumes 'npm run build' creates a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
      # If your build output is different, change the 'tar' command below.
      - name: Run build
        run: npm run build

      # 6. Update extension version from tag
      # This step extracts the version from the Git tag (e.g., v1.0.7 -> 1.0.7)
      # and updates the gemini-extension.json file with the new version.
      - name: Update extension version
        run: |
          VERSION=$(echo ${{ github.ref_name }} | sed 's/v//')
          sed -i "s/\"version\": \".*\"/\"version\": \"$VERSION\"/" gemini-extension.json

      # 7. Create TAR archive with MCP server dependencies
      # Exclude root node_modules but INCLUDE mcp-server/node_modules
      - name: Create TAR archive
        run: tar -cvzf ../nanobanana-release.tar.gz --exclude='.git' --exclude='.github' --exclude='./node_modules' . && mv ../nanobanana-release.tar.gz .

      # 8. Creates the GitHub Release
      # This step uses the 'gh' CLI (pre-installed on the runner) to:
      #   - Create a new release based on the tag you pushed.
      #   - Automatically generate release notes from your commits.
      #   - Upload the 'nanobanana-release.tar.gz' file as a release asset.
